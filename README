The AVR testing Dvice
To Make
	1)Open Makefile
	2) set the BURNMCU the the Chip Type
		ex)BURNMCU = attiny85
	
	3) set the BURNPROGRAMMER to the Chip Programer
		ex)BURNPROGRAMMER = buspirate
	
	4) set the PORTPRO the the Chip Programer's Port
		ex)	PORTPRO = /dev/tty.usbserial-Flashy 	//unix osx 
			PORTPRO = com3 							//windows
	
	5)	windows install Winavr (http://winavr.sourceforge.net/)
		OSX instal CrossPack (http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html)
		Unix install AVR dev tools (http://www.ladyada.net/learn/avr/setup-unix.html)
		
	6) 	windows open CMD and CD to sorce dir.
		unix & osx open a termanal and cd to sorce dir.
	
	7) Run Make
	
	8) Run Make burn

	9.- Don't compile for 'P' series chips - There is an issue in the driver where some interrupt tables
		are named in a way that isn't compatible with chips that have a 'p' after their name - i.e. ATmega168p,
		ATmega3280. This is tricky, since the code will compile, but just won't work. However,
		the 'p' series chips are binary compatible with their non-'p' cousins, so if you're working with 
		an ATmega168p, compile for a regular ATmega168. The ATmega328p has no non-p variant, but it's 
		binary-compatible with the ATmega168, so compile for the ATmega168. You may also try 
		defining "USB_INTR_VECTOR" as "INT0_vect" in "usbconfig.h", or replacing "SIG_INTERRUPT0" 
		with "INT0_vect" in "usbdrvasm.S" (around line 60 in version 20090822). 
		This problem may have already been fixed in version 20100715.
